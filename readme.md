# Challenge

 Each one of us will:
- fork the repo
- create a local folder
- link your remote repo to the local folder
    * git remote add origin YOUR-REPO.git
- pull the remote
    * git pull origin main
- make a new file in your local folder
- commit your changes
- push your updates to your online repos
- You may do that many times
